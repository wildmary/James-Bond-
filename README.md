# James Bond travels

The main aim of this projest was to visualize all movements that James Bond makes throughout al 24 movies made by EON Productions. It was always clear that JB travels a lot in every story but we like to visualize routs (like we did with Sherlock Holmes using Gephi) so we decided to use new tools and take travel visualizationto another level.

The main tool we used is geojon.io where we created a map with travels per film. Each actor has his own map with an exception for George Lazenby and Timothy Dalton. Every film in every map has its own colour. 

We took locations and travelling orders mainly from the English Wikipedia articles dedicated to the films. To double-check we used the site http://www.movie-locations.com. 

# Colours and markers explained
Many stories begin at MI6 in London - it is marked red with a star and is the only large marker.
When the story begins somewhere else, the first marker is coloured a bit darker and is star-stroked if it doesn't hold some important iformation.
The marker is coloured a bit lighter if it is not determined where exactly the action takes place (like in Tomorrow never dies where JB is introduced "somewhere near the Russian border")
The places where the main battle took place are markered "danger".
Markers often show how JB got there: by plane, helicopter or railway.

# Conclusions
Looking at the overall map which shows routes from all 24 films, we can tell a few things.
First, the Central Europe and the Alps were quite popular - perhaps because it is convenient for antagonists to build their bases there. On the other hand, JB doesn't enjoy travelling to France, Spain or Germany, which is a question for another project.
Second, the Far Eastern region appears in movies  often too, especially Hong Kong. 
Although JB doesn't travel to the USa that often, he never misses the opportunity to stop at Cuba and other Carribean islands, where the evil forces often build their bases.

Our suggestion for Mr. Bond would be to travel to Canada and Australia - great countries which he never had a chance to visit.
